1. roll
1d20 => 1..20
2d20 => 2..40
2d20 sum => same as above but printed out
2d20 adv => keep the highest
2d20 dis => keep the lowest

XdY <mode> - basic operand
X = number of dice
Y = number of faces of said dice
mode may not be specified, defaults to sum if so. Options are sum, adv(antage) and dis(advantage)

support for +, -, * and /
/ rounds down, while // rounds up

braces to treat a sequence as a single operand
2 (2d20 adv) adv = 4d20 adv
2 (2d20 adv) dis

2. chanceof
specifying the difficulty class will output not the roll but the chance of success
1d20 >= 12 => 45%
supports >=, <=, >, <, = and !=
